# Notepad
The platform used in this project is C# Windows Forms. This is not an exact notepad clone, but contains the same functionalities with text formatting. It's just an activity I did for an OOP class. The requirement was that we should create an application that merges notepad with microsoft word. Hence, the output. It still follows the same logic as the normal notepad. I wanted to share this, in case other people want to create a notepad clone.
This program is limited in its actual printing capabilities, so you would need to modify the related files.
